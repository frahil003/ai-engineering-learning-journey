## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to build a solid foundation in **applied AI engineering from a developer’s perspective**.

Rather than focusing purely on theory, the emphasis is on:
- understanding how modern AI systems work,
- applying AI concepts in real-world scenarios,
- and integrating AI capabilities into software projects.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

The repository covers (and will continue to expand on) the following topics:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Embeddings and vector representations
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Vector databases and similarity search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fundamentals
- AI pipelines and workflows
- Best practices for AI-powered applications
